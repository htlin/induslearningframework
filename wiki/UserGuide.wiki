This describes way to run the various classifiers in the Indus Learning Framework (ILF).

== Set Up and Configuration ==
Download the latest ILF jar.

In the directory you downloaded the ILF.jar, create a config directory. In it create a file called database.properties with following fields
{{{
DataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
DataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/db_research
DataSource.username=ilf_user
DataSource.password=ilf_password
}}}
Change the values as appropriate to your case. These are used to make connection to the database that contains the learning instances

== Command Line Options ==

The Ilf.jar depends on the following jars:
 * WEKA (weka.jar)  for some utility functions
 * appropriate jdbc driver (e.g  mysql-connector-java-5.0.7-bin.jar)
 * DBCP commons (e.g. commons-dbcp-1.2.2.jar ) http://commons.apache.org/dbcp/
 
When calling from command line the  -classpath option is to use to point to these jars (alternatively environment variable CLASSPATH can be set)

 * Naive Bayes
_ java -classpath < semi colon seperated list of dependent jars and ilf.jar> airldm2.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayesClassifier <options> _

 * Decision Trees
_ java -classpath < semi colon seperated list of dependent jars and ilf.jar> airldm2.classifiers.trees.id3Classifier <options> _

=== Supported Options ===

   * * -a *    The training file is to be read from an arff file and inserted into database.

   * * -b *     The training instances are in a  relational database.

   * * -trainTable*  The Name of the table  which contains training instances (used in conjuction with flag -b).  

   * * -testFile * The arff file against which to test.

   * * -trainFile * The arff file which contains training instances ( use in conjuction with flag -a ).

==Major Classses==
The following are the major classes in the learning framework.
 * *Classifier:* Interface which every new classifier must implement. Current implementation includes Na√Øve Bayes and Decision Trees.  

 * *LDInstances:*   A large data set instance which may possibly exceed the size that can be stored in memory. It consists of data descriptor (Desc(D))  and a handle to the  datsource  that answers sufficient statistics.

 * *SSDataSource:*  Interface that every  datasource that  answers sufficient statistics queries will implement.  Current implementation has RelationalDataSource.  Future one will have IndusDataSource.

 * *ReplaceMissingValue:*  An unsupervised filter that replaces missing values by assigning the counts proportionally. Classifiers can call the function in this filter to get modified counts.

 * *Evaluation:*  Evaluates the given classifier on train and test data to return a Confusion matrix. Any implemented Classifier will automatically have access to this.

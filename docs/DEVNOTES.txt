Notes for RDF(Relational) Features
==================================

1. Library for connecting to SPARQL endpoints
- sesame-2.3.2 depends on httpclient 3.1, but higher version of httpclient is not compatible.
- httpclient depends on
	commons-codec
	commons-logging
	httpcore
	(see http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/dependencies.html)
	
2. SPARQL endpoint requirements
- Has to support SPARQL 1.1+ (with aggregation COUNT/AVG/MIN/MAX, and nested query)
- Reminder: for numerical attributes using AVG/MIN/MAX aggregation,
	the RDF node has to declare a numerical type, e.g. rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int"
  Otherwise SPARQL select statements will not pick them up

3. SPARQL endpoint errors
  Few non-standard SPARQL servers return errors when we try to pose a query to them.
  One reason is explained in http://www.openrdf.org/forum/mvnforum/viewthread?thread=1527
  In this case the server only recognizes "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" as the request content type,
  but Sesame sends "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8", resulting an
  HTTP ERROR: 415 Must be application/x-www-form-urlencoded
